 <p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">The Algerian army has surrounded a natural gas complex where armed fighters are holding a group of foreign workers, after at least two people were killed in a raid near a southern Algerian gas field.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">About 20 gunmen are believed to have been behind the attack, which was apparently in retaliation against France's intervention in Mali.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Thirty Algerian workers reportedly escaped from the desert gas facility on Thursday, Reuters news agency quoted the country's official APS1 news agency as saying.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">It did not say how they eluded their captors.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Al JaZEEra spoke to some of the hostages by telephone on Thursday, but it was unclear whether or not they were speaking under duress. More details will be released shortly.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">A spokesperson for the "Masked Brigade", claiming to hold the hostages, said on Wednesday that the operation near the In Amenas222222222 field was to punish Algeria for allowing French&nbsp;fight planes&nbsp;to use its airspace in attacking al-Qaeda-linked rebel groups in Mali.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">"Forty-one Westerners including seven Americans, French, British and Japanese citizens have been taken hostage," the spokesperson said.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">"The operation was in response to the blatant interference by Algeria and the opening of its air space to French aircraft to bomb northern Mali."</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">ANI333333333333 said the&nbsp;fighters demanded an end to French military operations in return for the safety of the hostages.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Statoil, the Norwegian firm that is involved in running the field, held a press conference on Thursday.<br /><br />Al Jazeera's Paul Brennan said that the company did not want to give too many details due to the security concerns.<br /><br />"Employees of Statoil are trained regularly for all kinds of different scenarios, including the possibility of hostage taking," the company said during the press conference.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">The In Amenas gas field is jointly operated by British oil giant BP, Norway's Statoil and Algeria's Sonatrach.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">The Algerian interior ministry said: "A terrorist group, heavily armed and using three vehicles, launched an attack this Wednesday at 5am against a Sonatrach base in Tigantourine, near In Amenas, about 100km from the Algerian and Libyan border."</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><strong>Official account</strong></p>
<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">One Briton and an Algerian were killed in the attack, Interior Minister Dahou Ould Kablia said. Seven others were reportedly injured.</p>

<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">William Hague, the British foreign secretary, confirmed the death of a Briton on Thursday, but rejected any link to the crisis in Mali, calling that an excuse for "cold-blooded murder."</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">"While sadly I can confirm the death of one British national, I can't confirm at this point the exact number of hostages held," he said.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">The&nbsp;attack began with the ambush of a bus carrying employees from the gas plant to the nearby airport but the attackers were driven off, according to the Algerian government, which said three vehicles of heavily armed men were involved.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">"After their failed attempt, the terrorist group headed to the complex's living quarters and took a number of workers with foreign nationalities hostage," the&nbsp;government said.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">The interior minister was quoted&nbsp;by official news agency APS as saying: "The Algerian authorities will not respond to the demands of the terrorists and will not negotiate."</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Hundreds of Algerians work at the plant and were taken hostage in the attack, but the state news agency reported that they had gradually been released in small groups, unharmed.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><strong>Hostage situation</strong></p>
<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">The exact number of hostages could not immediately be confirmed.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">An Algerian member of parliament said four Japanese and one Frenchmen were kidnapped in the raid, while the Irish foreign ministry said an Irish citizen was among the hostages.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Thirteen Norwegian Statoil employees were involved in the hostage situation, Jens Stoltenberg, the Norwegian prime minister,&nbsp;said.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">The US state department confirmed that US citizens were also among the hostages taken.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">The Masked Brigade was formed by al-Qaeda's longtime&nbsp;figure in the Sahara region, Moktar Belmoktar, a one-eyed Algerian who recently declared he was leaving the&nbsp;network's Algerian branch, al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, for his own group.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">France launched a major offensive against&nbsp;the rebel group Ansar al-Dine in Mali on January 11 to prevent them from advancing on the capital, Bamako.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Algeria announced on Tuesday that it had closed its border with Mali, but the 2,000km desert frontier is almost impossible to seal.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Algeria had long warned against military intervention against the rebels, fearing the violence could spill over&nbsp;the border.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Though its position softened slightly after French President Francois Hollande visited Algiers in December, Algerian authorities remain sceptical about the operation.</p>

    <p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Thick smoke envelops the site of the helicopter crash in central London yesterday.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Reuters/</strong><strong>London</strong></span></p>
<p>A helicopter crashed into a crane on top of one of Europe&rsquo;s tallest residential blocks yesterday, killing two people as it burst into flames and spiralled down into rush-hour traffic close to the Houses of Parliament in central London.</p>
<p>Police said there was nothing to suggest a terrorism link to the crash on a foggy morning on the south bank of the River Thames, less than a mile from parliament, its secret services headquarters and the site of a new US embassy.</p>
<p>In parliament, later in the day, Prime Minister David Cameron said helicopter flights over a city with an increasing number of huge skyscrapers needed to be carefully examined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a big bang and bits started showering down, then there was an explosion down the road,&rdquo; said truck driver Ray Watts whose vehicle was hit by falling debris. &ldquo;We saw the fireball down there and the smoke. We didn&rsquo;t know what way to run because there were bits coming down everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Witnesses said the helicopter hit a crane on top of the as-yet unoccupied 185-metre high cylindrical block - The Tower, One St George Wharf - spun out of control, fell to the ground and burst into flames, setting nearby buildings alight.</p>
<p>Wreckage was strewn across roads close to Vauxhall train station, a major transport hub near the south bank of the River Thames, which was packed with thousands of commuters at the time of the incident shortly after 0800GMT.</p>
<p>Tangled bits of crane could be seen hanging off the side of the tower, the top of which was still shrouded by low cloud an hour after the crash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is something of a miracle that this was not many, many times worse given the time of day that this happened,&rdquo; police Commander Neil Basu told reporters.</p>
<p>The fire service said it had rescued one man from a burning car.</p>
<p>Basu said the helicopter was believed to be on a commercial flight from Redhill, south of the capital, to Elstree, home to famous British film studios north of London, but had been diverted to a heliport near the crash site. He said there were 13 casualties.</p>
<p>The pilot was one of those killed and it was not thought anyone else was on board. One other person was found dead near the wreckage.</p>
<p>The helicopter involved was an Italian-made twin-engined AgustaWestland 109, the company&rsquo;s best-selling VIP corporate helicopter, according to a source familiar with the situation.</p>
<p>Edmir Pishtar, who was in a van outside the site, said he spoke to the operator who was about to get into the crane cab. &ldquo;He was literally shaking because he was getting ready to climb into the crane and he was late,&rdquo; Pishtar said.</p>
<p>Roads around the area including a route over the Thames were closed off, and bus and rail services were affected.</p>
<p>The department of transport&rsquo;s crash investigation unit said it had launched an inquiry and it could be several months before it produced a definitive report. Neither the tower&rsquo;s developer, Berkeley Group, nor police would speculate on the cause of the crash.</p>
<p>Helicopters should normally fly 500 feet above tall structures. Despite its proximity to landmarks such as the headquarters of Britain&rsquo;s MI6 international intelligence agency, police quickly ruled out an attack by militants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Witnesses tell of terror from the sky as wreckage crashes</strong></span></p>
<p>Workers and commuters yesterday told how they had to run for their lives as the helicopter and parts of the crane came crashing down.</p>
<p>Michael Krumstets was on his way to work when he saw the aircraft hurtling towards him. &ldquo;The helicopter nearly killed me and my flatmate,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We were right next to it, just feet away from where it exploded. We were walking to work and saw the helicopter clip the top of the crane &mdash; there was a loud crack &mdash; and it came spinning out of control towards us. I just can&rsquo;t believe what I saw, it was awful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you see a helicopter hurtling out of the sky towards you, spinning, your legs turn to jelly, you have a sense of shock. My flatmate fell over, I had to run back to grab him. It missed us by just a few feet, it was just so lucky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Krumstets, 45, who works for courier company, added: &ldquo;Nobody would have got out of there alive. It would have been impossible. It hit the crane and then it hit the building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It crashed on one side of the road and we were on the other. Someone else was in shock, they had come off their bike, we ran back to help them and give them water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chloe Dooknah, 19, said the helicopter exploded when it hit the ground and appeared to strike two cars, one of them a Mini. &ldquo;There was metal flying everywhere. It narrowly missed a train that was going over the bridge. People were running out of their cars. The guys from the building site were helping evacuate everybody before the police arrived. The whole road was on fire, people were screaming and also lots of people were also trying to help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Raphael Hudson, who was at the nearby Covent Garden flower market, said the whole road caught fire. He added: &ldquo;It was just alight, it was really, really horrible. There were people running around. I looked behind me and there were bits of crane hanging off. I lost my bearings because there was so much smoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Others said they feared a bomb had gone off. Loughborough MP Nicky Morgan told BBC News: &ldquo;I heard a bang and thought it could be an explosion. The black smoke really meant this is not right. I wondered if it was a bomb explosion. It sounded like a building coming down or being hit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cleaner Fernando Carmona, 44, said the flames were three storeys high and caused &ldquo;sheer panic&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Builder Charlie Lawrence, 23, rushed to help the walking wounded, steering people away from leaking petrol. He said: &ldquo;There were flames and lots of confused people needing help. There were cars and motorbikes across the road. It was a disaster scene, what more can I say? I tried to do what I could to help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crane was on top of The Tower, One St George Wharf, which will be Britain&rsquo;s highest residential building when it is completed and one of the tallest in Europe at just under 600 feet. It was given the go ahead by John Prescott in 2005 in a decision that overruled Lambeth council and the planning inspector amid concerns about its height and proximity to the Houses of Parliament.</p>
<p>Work on the building started in 2010 and is due to be finished next year with 223 flats.</p>
<p>A spokesman for developer St George said: &ldquo;We can confirm a helicopter collided with a crane at St George Wharf at 8am. Our thoughts are with the friends and families of those killed or injured in this tragic incident. Emergency services are on the scene and authorities are investigating the circumstances. We are offering our full support and assistance to the emergency services.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One worker in an office overlooking the tower said: &ldquo;I saw a flash and the helicopter plunged to the ground. You can imagine the smoke that came out of it. I think it was heading to the heliport. It is one of the tallest residential towers. I imagine in this misty morning the lights weren&rsquo;t on or he couldn&rsquo;t see them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The helicopter completely exploded. It fell on the Wandsworth Road very close to the mainline.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Michael Gavin was waiting for a train. He said: &ldquo;I heard the bang and saw the body of the helicopter falling to the ground along with parts of the crane. It obviously looked very serious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob Easton, an electrician, said: &ldquo;I heard a great explosion and saw smoke reflected in the windows. People were panicking and worrying. It was bedlam. It is one of the worst things I have seen in real life. A lot of girls broke down in tears. It shook everyone up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another witness said he saw the impact between the crane and helicopter, adding: &ldquo;It was making a terrible noise and then got lower and lower before crashing. It was really frightening and terrible to see. It was like something out of a film.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chris Matheson said he heard a loud thud as the helicopter hit the crane, and then there was silence. He added: &ldquo;There was suddenly an unusual thudding sound and then silence which caught my imagination the most and made me worry there was a real problem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a very thick tall plume of smoke in the immediate aftermath and quite a severe fire burning.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>In a lovely little panegyric for the distinguished European philosopher Slavoj Zizek, <a class="internallink" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2012/12/20121224122215406939.html" target="_blank">published recently on Al Jazeera</a>, we read:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><em>There are many important and active philosophers today: Judith Butler in the United States, Simon Critchley in England, Victoria Camps in Spain, Jean-Luc Nancy in France, Chantal Mouffe in Belgium, Gianni Vattimo in Italy, Peter Sloterdijk in Germany and in Slovenia, Slavoj Zizek, not to mention others working in Brazil, Australia and China.</em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>What immediately strikes the reader when seeing this opening paragraph is the unabashedly European character and disposition of the thing the author calls "philosophy today" - thus laying a claim on both the subject and time that is peculiar and in fact an exclusive property of Europe.</p>
    <p>Even Judith Butler who is cited as an example from the United States is decidedly a product of European philosophical genealogy, thinking somewhere between Derrida and Foucault, brought to bear on our understanding of gender and sexuality.</p>
    <p>To be sure, China and Brazil (and Australia, which is also a European extension) are cited as the location of other philosophers worthy of the designation, but none of them evidently merits a specific name to be sitting next to these eminent European philosophers.</p>
    <p>The question of course is not the globality of philosophical visions that all these prominent European (and by extension certain American) philosophers indeed share and from which people from the deepest corners of Africa to the remotest villages of India, China, Latin America, and the Arab and Muslim world ("deep and far", that is, from a fictive European centre) can indeed learn and better understand their lives.</p>
    <p>That goes without saying, for without that confidence and self-consciousness these philosophers and the philosophical traditions they represent can scarce lay any universal claim on our epistemic credulities, nor would they be able to put pen to paper or finger to keyboard and write a sentence.</p>
    <p><strong>Thinkers outside Europe </strong></p>
    <p>These are indeed not only eminent philosophers, but the philosophy they practice has the globality of certain degrees of self-conscious confidence without which no thinking can presume universality.</p>
    <p>The question is rather something else: What about other thinkers who operate outside this European philosophical pedigree, whether they practice their thinking in the European languages they have colonially inherited or else in their own mother tongues - in Asia, in Africa, in Latin America, thinkers that have actually earned the dignity of a name, and perhaps even the pedigree of a "public intellectual" not too dissimilar to Hannah Arendt, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Michel Foucault that in this piece on Al Jazeera are offered as predecessors of Zizek?</p>

    <p><!-- PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY-->What about thinkers outside the purview of these European philosophers; how are we to name and designate and honour and learn from them with the epithet of "public intellectual" in the age of globalised media?</p>
    <p>Do the constellation of thinkers from South Asia, exemplified by leading figures like Ashis Nandy, Partha Chatterjee, Gayatri Spivak, Ranajit Guha, Sudipta Kaviraj, Dipesh Chakrabarty, Homi Bhabha, or Akeel Bilgrami, come together to form a nucleus of thinking that is conscious of itself? Would that constellation perhaps merit the word "thinking" in a manner that would qualify one of them - as a South Asian - to the term "philosopher" or "public intellectuals"?</p>
    <p>Are they "South Asian thinkers" or "thinkers", the way these European thinkers are? Why is it that if Mozart sneezes it is "music" (and I am quite sure the great genius even sneezed melodiously) but the most sophisticated Indian music ragas are the subject of "ethnomusicology"?</p>
    <p>Is that "ethnos" not also applicable to the philosophical thinking that Indian philosophers practice - so much so that their thinking is more the subject of Western European and North American anthropological fieldwork and investigation?</p>
    <p>We can turn around and look at Africa. What about thinkers like Henry Odera Oruka, Ngugi wa Thiong'o, Wole Soyinka, Chinua Achebe, Okot p'Bitek, Taban Lo Liyong, Achille Mbembe, Emmanuel Chukwudi Eze, Souleymane Bachir Diagne, V.Y. Mudimbe: Would they qualify for the term "philosopher" or "public intellectuals" perhaps, or is that also "ethnophilosophy"?</p>
    <p>Why is European philosophy "philosophy", but African philosophy ethnophilosophy, the way Indian music is ethnomusic - an ethnographic logic that is based on the very same reasoning that if you were to go to the New York Museum of Natural History (popularised in Shawn Levy's <em>Night at the Museum</em> [2006]), you only see animals and non-white peoples and their cultures featured inside glass cages, but no cage is in sight for white people and their cultures - they just get to stroll through the isles and enjoy the power and ability of looking at taxidermic Yaks, cave dwellers, elephants, Eskimos, buffalo, Native Americans, etc, all in a single winding row.</p>
    <p>The same ethnographic gaze is evident in the encounter with the intellectual disposition of the Arab or Muslim world: Azmi Bishara, Sadeq Jalal Al-Azm, Fawwaz Traboulsi, Abdallah Laroui, Michel Kilo, Abdolkarim Soroush. The list of prominent thinkers and is endless.</p>
    <p>In Japan, Kojan Karatani, in Cuba, Roberto Fernandez Retamar, or even in the United States people like Cornel West, whose thinking is not entirely in the European continental tradition - what about them? Where do they fit in? Can they think - is what they do also thinking, philosophical, pertinent, perhaps, or is that also suitable for ethnographic examinations?</p>
    <p>The question of Eurocentricism is now entirely blase. Of course Europeans are Eurocentric and see the world from their vantage point, and why should they not? They are the inheritors of multiple (now defunct) empires and they still carry within them the phantom hubris of those empires and they think their particular philosophy is "philosophy" and their particular thinking is "thinking", and everything else is - as the great European philosopher Immanuel Levinas was wont of saying - "dancing".</p>
    <p>The question is rather the manner in which non-European thinking can reach self-consciousness and evident universality, not at the cost of whatever European philosophers may think of themselves for the world at large, but for the purpose of offering alternative (complementary or contradictory) visions of reality more rooted in the lived experiences of people in Africa, in Asia, in Latin America - counties and climes once under the spell of the thing that calls itself "the West" but happily no more.</p>
    <p>The trajectory of contemporary thinking around the globe is not spontaneously conditioned in our own immediate time and disparate locations, but has a much deeper and wider spectrum that goes back to earlier generations of thinkers ranging from Jos&eacute; Marti to Jamal al-Din al-Afghani, to Aime Cesaire, W.E.B. DuBois, Liang Qichao, Frantz Fanon, Rabindranath Tagore, Mahatma Gandhi, etc.</p>
    <p>So the question remains why not the dignity of "philosophy" and whence the anthropological curiosity of "ethnophilosophy"?</p>
    <p>Let's seek the answer from Europe itself - but from the subaltern of Europe.</p>
    <p><strong>'The Intellectuals as a Cosmopolitan Stratum'</strong></p>
    <p>In his <em>Prison Notebooks</em>, Antonio Gramsci has a short discussion about Kant's famous phrase in <em>Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals</em> (1785) that is quite critical in our understanding of what it takes for a philosopher to become universally self-conscious, to think of himself as the measure and yardstick of globality. Gramsci's stipulation is critical here - and here is how he begins:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><em>Kant's maxim "act in such a way that your conduct can become a norm for all men in similar conditions" is less simple and obvious than it appears at first sight. What is meant by 'similar conditions'?</em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>To be sure, and as Quintin Hoare and Geoffrey Nowell Smith (the editors and translators of the English translation of Gramsci's <em>Prison Notebooks</em>) note, Gramsci here in fact misquotes Kant, and that "similar conditions" does not appear in the original text, where the German philosopher says: "I am never to act otherwise than so that I could also will that my maxim should become a universal law." This principle, called "the categorical imperative", is in fact the very foundation of Kantian ethics.</p>
    <p>So where Kant says "universal law", Gramsci says, "a norm for all men", and then he adds an additional "similar conditions", which is not in the German original.</p>
    <table class="Skyscrapper_Body" style="border-style: solid; border-color: white; width: 250px; float: right; border-collapse: collapse; background-color: #fb9d04;" border="10">

    </td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
    <p><!-- PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY-->That misquoting is quite critical here. Gramsci's conclusion is that the reason Kant can say what he says and offer his own behaviour as measure of universal ethics is that "Kant's maxim presupposes a single culture, a single religion, a 'world-wide' conformism... Kant's maxim is connected with his time, with the cosmopolitan enlightenment and the critical conception of the author. In brief, it is linked to the philosophy of the intellectuals as a cosmopolitan stratum".</p>
    <p>What in effect Gramsci discovers, as a southern Italian suffering in the dungeons of European fascism, is what in Brooklyn we call <em>chutzpah</em>, to think yourself the centre of universe, a self-assuredness that gives the philosopher that certain panache and authority to think in absolutists and grand narrative terms.</p>

    <p><em>Therefore the agent is the bearer of the "similar conditions" and indeed their creator. That is, he "must" act according to a "model" which he would like to see diffused among all mankind, according to a type of civilisation for whose coming he is working-or for whose preservation he is "resisting" the forces that threaten its disintegration.</em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>It is precisely that self-confidence, that self-consciousness, that audacity to think yourself the agent of history that enables a thinker to think his particular thinking is "Thinking" in universal terms, and his philosophy "Philosophy" and his city square "The Public Space", and thus he a globally recognised Public Intellectual.</p>
    <p>There is thus a direct and unmitigated structural link between an empire, or an imperial frame of reference, and the presumed universality of a thinker thinking in the bosoms of that empire.</p>
    <p>As all other people, Europeans are perfectly entitled to their own self-centrism.</p>
    <p>The imperial hubris that once enabled that Eurocentricism and still produces the infomercials of the sort we read in Al Jazeera for Zizek are the phantom memories of the time that "the West" had assured confidence and a sense of its own universalism and globality, or as Gramsci put it, "to a type of civilisation for whose coming he is working".</p>
    <p>But that globality is no more - people from every clime and continent are up and about claiming their own cosmopolitan worldliness and with it their innate ability to think beyond the confinements of that Eurocentricism, which to be sure is still entitled to its phantom pleasures of thinking itself the centre of the universe. The Gramscian superimposed "similar conditions" are now emerging in multiple cites of the liberated humanity.</p>
    <p>The world at large, and the Arab and Muslim world in particular, is going through world historic changes - these changes have produced thinkers, poets, artists, and public intellectuals at the centre of their moral and politcial imagination - all thinking and acting in terms at once domestic to their immediate geography and yet global in its consequences.</p>
    <p>Compared to those liberating tsunamis now turning the world upside down, cliche-ridden assumption about Europe and its increasingly provincialised philosophical pedigree is a tempest in the cup. Reduced to its own fair share of the humanity at large, and like all other continents and climes, Europe has much to teach the world, but now on a far more leveled and democratic playing field, where its philosophy is European philosophy not "Philosophy", its music European music not "Music", and no infomercial would be necessary to sell its public intellectuals as "Public Intellectuals".</p>
