Dear Abdulraoof,

Thanks for your email. Following your conversations with Caroline, I’ve set you up with an API key for Collins English Dictionary only:


wDrAuSB0QaBFLXUnibm0aCNpPv4SrZoJ7saWiwtxeZAvbZzpCQorLnrlHAxm2wva


It is valid for one year. Should you wish to renew it at the end of that period, please get in touch with us again.

The key is limited to 5,000 calls per month. Should you approach that limit or should you wish to be able to surpass it then we will need to sign a short contract setting out the commercial terms of an agreement.

Attached is a document which should contain all the information you need to get started. If there are any questions or issues that come up then please do get in touch.

Good luck with the development and please send me a link once you've got it up and running. I'd love to see what you do with our content.

All the best,

Rachel
